This is an experimental project in which I am playing around with events in C++
by writing one of my favorite simple programs, Conway's Game of Life. The
purpose is for me to learn more about C++ and small-scale event-driven
programming by getting my hands dirty, and to have fun, not to put forward
useful software or great concepts.

I'm also doing a parallel project in C#.
